This is a hack. A damn ugly one.

Basically, it's an interface to 23b's open access control system implementing
the spaces API v 0.11 (https://hackerspaces.nl/spaceapi/)

It does lots of nasty and gross stuff, and I want you to fork this and make it
better. :)

== Using ==
Dump it in to the webserver CGI-bin on a system connected via serial to your 
OAC, as long as that server can handle ruby cgi.
